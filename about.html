            <p style="text-indent:50px;font-size: 22px;font-weight: 500;position: relative;transform: translateY(50px);"> The coronavirus lockdown will have an adverse effect on the agriculture sector in India. The nationwide lockdown has entrenched the economic system. The sector is facing a lot of trouble with labourers and movement of goods. Even as agriculture
                produce is exempted from lockdown directives being an essential commodity, policemen are creating a lot of problems for the sector. Indian agriculture sector, which suffered recently due to an uneven monsoon, will face another hit due
                to disruptions from the coronavirus. As Rabi harvest season approaches, farmers worry about their standing crops. Farmers growing wheat, mustard and pulses already complained about their crops damage due to untimely and heavy rainfall
                recently. This led to farmers fixing their crops but amid Coronavirus lockdown most of the labourers available fled to their homes. As the restriction on movement of goods continues amid the lockdown, the farmers are likely to feel the
                pinch in their income. The government has also received reports on potatoes lying harvested on fields due to a shortage of labour. Coronavirus lockdown has impacted the supply chain of agricultural commodities. By taking a toll on the
                loading and unloading of agricultural produce. Also, the lockdown has hampered the movement of trucks carrying essential commodities. Several cold storage and warehouse owners complained regarding the dearth of laborers. Unwillingness
                to work fearing police beating, many labourers are staying home or leaving for their hometown. <br><br>

                This website is an ideal tool for connecting government with the farmers and people who are facing a product shortage crisis.The government will have the authority to maintain a database of farmers and make relevant distributions for the people who are
                facing a crisis.With the help of this web-app the customers need not actually go to market for buying the items which satisfies the social distancing factor. The main aim of this app is to create social distancing and a user friendly environment
                for the government to analyze the data collected at village level and people who are facing shortage.
